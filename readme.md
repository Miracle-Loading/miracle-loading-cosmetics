## Requirements
<p><a href="https://www.tutsmake.com/install-laravel-on-windows-with-composer/">PHP and Laravel installation on Windows</a></p>
<p><a href="https://demonuts.com/install-laravel/">PHP and Laravel installation on Mac or Ubuntu</a></p>
<p>If you have trouble installing PHP/Composer/Laravel, please let Analilia know! These articles may use an older version of PHP but be sure to get PHP 7.3 for our project. 
    
I HIGHLY recommend using products from JetBrains. If you have the GitHub student pack, you can use it for free. Please download PHPStorm and DataGrip for our project! Go to <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">Github student pack</a> to get it for free. Just provide a student ID. 

This ReadMe will be updated as more information arrive.

## Workflow 
The web app will be hosted on heroku. You will not need an account on heroku at all! You will simply clone from this repository. Please create your own branch and DO NOT push to master. Analilia will do a code review once a week and approve any attempt to push to master. Please become familiar with github. :) 

We will use a kanban board (will be explained at our meeting) to plan our tasks. You will be assigned a task based on your roles specified in the SRS.
